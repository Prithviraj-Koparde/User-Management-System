- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org)  
- [Java JDK 11+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prithviraj-Koparde/User-Management-System.git
Change to the frontend directory:

bash
cd User-Management-System/frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
Start the Angular development server:

bash
ng serve
Navigate to http://localhost:4200 in your browser to see the app running.

Backend Setup
Change to the backend directory:

bash
cd User-Management-System/backend
Edit the application.properties file (or application.yml) to configure your PostgreSQL connection:

properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Build the project using Maven:

bash
mvn clean install
Run the Spring Boot application:

bash
mvn spring-boot:run
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8081.

API Endpoints
The backend exposes several RESTful endpoints for user management:

Create User: POST /api/users

Retrieve Users: GET /api/users

Retrieve a Specific User: GET /api/users/{id}

Update User: PUT /api/users/{id}

Delete User: DELETE /api/users/{id}

Usage
After starting both the frontend and backend services, you can manage users through the applicationâ€™s UI or interact directly with the REST API using tools like Postman or cURL.
